Today I interviewed with Jeffy. Jeffy was born in India and moved to the United States at the age of 14. She just went back to India for the first after she finished her undergraduate degree this past summer, for the first time in 8 years. It must have been tough not going seeing her family and friends for so long, as I can imagine myself, but she said "it's better here".

She lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It must be cold, because the first question she asked me was "How do you like the weather in California?". I don't have a strong feeling for the weather, but it might mean differently for people who don't get to enjoy it.

Her favorite food is Sushi, and least favorite is pinneaple. I think she needs to give pinneapple another chance.

We have a lot in common, besides mentioned above, that we were both born oversea, and we miss our homes to certain degrees, we are also both ambitious young professionals interested in a career in research. I think there will be a lot more that we can share.
