Today we were just doing our final presentations. I also figured that I am in this privilegded position to write our last blog (or is it?), so I was wondering if it would make sense for me to just write about some of my own reflections from the last two weeks of exercises.

### Coding
I came from a background with intensive coding practices, so the concepts of unit tests, version controls were never new to me. However, I did find a lot of concepts new and refreshing. I knew numpy from before, but I only knew vaguely that there were all these cool arithmetics that you can only do in numpy, but not any other languages. It was the first time that I learnt in this course, that the reason numpy was so fast was that it's a structured array, and a python list was not. I never reallized that the reason you can do something like this

```
a = [True, "2", 3]
```

in Python is that its lists are unstructured. Why would people make such an unruly language? - but it's so good.

### Chemistry
It has been four years since I graduated out of my undegraduate, which I suffered at the time, but since I came out I always wished an opportunity to go back to schools. Working a job is great that you can have all the freedom you want to do things, but it's not so great that you can see through the end of your career. Promotions are desirable, but every one can get there sooner or later. It is exciting to go back to school. I'd like to imagine "where this program can bring me to", "Can I publish a paper with this research topic", or "What can I learn from this course?".

That was the chemistry I had with UC. Berkeley and this program, but on a more serieous note, learning about LJ simuilations was fun :) My job would have never taught me that.
