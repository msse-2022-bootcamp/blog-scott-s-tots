## Where is your team member from?
Yangyi Hao is from Beijing, China where he lived most of his life. At 18 years old, Yangyi moved to the United States to attend university. After graduating, Yangyi moved to California to look for a job. Yangyi currently works at Google.

## Where do they live?
Yangyi currently lives in the SF Bay Area, specifically in Mountain View, CA.

## What is your favorite food? What is your least favorite food?
Yangyi can not express enough just how much he enjoys eating sushi. In particular, Yangyi mentioned he likes Nigiri and Sesame sushi the most. Yangyi, however, dislikes pumpkin.

## What is one thing the two of you have in common (that isnâ€™t the MSSE program)?
Yangyi and I both live in the Bay Area and both hold software engineering jobs.

## Why did they choose the MSSE degree?
Yangyi chose the MSSE program since it will help expand Yangyi's chemistry knowledge. The program will also be an excursion outside of his regular job responsibilities. He believes that if you don't actively try something new, then you'll will be limited and have the same job throughout life.
